# CrowPanel Advance 5.0 and 7.0

Use the matching environment for an N16R8 CrowPanel Advance board:

- `elecrow-s3-8048c050-advance-v13_16MB`: 5-inch DIS02050A PCB V1.3
- `elecrow-s3-8048c070-advance-v13_16MB`: 7-inch PCB V1.3, V1.4 or V1.5

These are separate profiles from the older WZ8048C050 and WZ8048C070
boards; their RGB, touch and board-controller settings must not be reused
for an Advance display. The 7-inch V1.2 board is also not supported because
it uses a different backlight-controller protocol.

Include `user_setups/esp32s3/crowpanel-hmi.ini` in the PlatformIO
configuration's `extra_configs`, then select this environment by name.

The profiles configure the 800 × 480 RGB panel and GT911 touch controller
using Elecrow's LovyanGFX examples for the
[5-inch V1.2/V1.3 board](https://github.com/Elecrow-RD/CrowPanel-Advance-5-HMI-ESP32-S3-AI-Powered-IPS-Touch-Screen-800x480/blob/19b0f58cdb046493238f1dbf2e04215cf8d6bdec/example/V1.2_and_V1.3/Arduino/lesson-03/BigInch_LVGL/LovyanGFX_Driver.h)
and the
[7-inch V1.3/V1.4/V1.5 board](https://github.com/Elecrow-RD/CrowPanel-Advance-7-HMI-ESP32-S3-AI-Powered-IPS-Touch-Screen-800x480/blob/master/example/V1.3_and_V1.4_and_V1.5/Arduino/lesson-03/BigInch_LVGL/LovyanGFX_Driver.h).
GPIO15/16 carry the shared I²C bus. The board's controller at address `0x30`
handles backlight commands; the GT911 is at `0x5D`. Backlight values are
inverted: `0` is brightest and `245` is off. Values above `245` are reserved
for controller commands. Startup performs bounded touch activation using
GPIO1 if the GT911 does not initially respond. If the controller at `0x30`
is missing, the board-specific code does not pulse GPIO1 or send backlight
commands. These behaviors follow Elecrow's [5-inch V1.2/V1.3 startup example](https://github.com/Elecrow-RD/CrowPanel-Advance-5-HMI-ESP32-S3-AI-Powered-IPS-Touch-Screen-800x480/blob/19b0f58cdb046493238f1dbf2e04215cf8d6bdec/example/V1.2_and_V1.3/Arduino/lesson-03/BigInch_LVGL/BigInch_LVGL.ino)
and the corresponding 7-inch example.

Before using either profile on hardware, confirm the supported PCB marking
and that the module is the N16R8 variant. The 5-inch V1.3 profile has been
tested on real hardware. The 7-inch profile is build-tested only; after
flashing, verify the image, touch coordinates, brightness and off/on
commands on a real panel. A successful build alone cannot validate display
wiring or board-controller behavior.
